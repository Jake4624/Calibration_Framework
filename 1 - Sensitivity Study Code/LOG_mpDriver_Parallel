## This document describes the commands, files, and scripts needed to perform Objective 1 of the dissertation
## proposal (sensitivity analysis for all inputs of the Nitinol user material by doing a bi-level full
## factorial analysis).

First need to make sure the following files are all in the same directory:
  1) makefile                             - This compiles the fortran code and gets everything ready to run
  2) mpDriverUmat_Taylor.f90              - The material point simulation code
  3) Updated_Umat.f                       - User material
  4) texture.inc                          - Texture which will be used for simulations
  5) mpDriver_Property_Input_Generator.py - Generates properties for a full factorial DOE
  6) Set_Up_mpDriver_Parallel.py          - Makes subfolders and sets everything up to run mpDriver in 
                                            multiple terminal windows at the same time
  7) Submit_File.sub                      - Batch file which submits job to Pangea. Sends job to a node 
                                            so the head node is not jammed up with jobs.
  8) Clean_mpDriver_Parallel.py           - Removes all folders and files generated by 
                                            Set_Up_mpDriver_Parallel.py (make sure the number of subfolders
                                            is the same as what is used in Set_Up_mpDriver_Parallel.py)
  9) compile_fortran_code.py              - Compiles mpDriverUmat code in all subfolders generated by
                                            Set_Up_mpDriver_Parallel.py so it is ready to run (make sure the 
                                            number of subfolders is the same as what is used in 
                                            Set_Up_mpDriver_Parallel.py)
 10) run_mpDriver_parallel.py             - Goes into each subfolder and submits the batch file that is
                                            in each subfolder. (make sure the number of subfolders is the
                                            same as what is used in Set_Up_mpDriver_Parallel.py)

Setting everything up and running mpDriver simulations
  1) Generate the texture using the writeTexture.py script. Details on how to use the script are in
     the beginning of the script.
  2) After the quaternion_texture.txt file is made using writeTexture.py, use Matlab to run firstPoleFigure.m 
     script to generate texture.inc which has the Euler angles converted from quaternion_texture.txt
     and also a pole figure to display the texture.
  3) Need to make sure that the name of the Umat in the makefile is the same as the umat in the directory. 
     Also check that the proper fortran compiler is being used.
  4) Make sure the subfolder number in Set_Up_mpDriver_Parallel.py and run_mpDriver_parallel.py are the same
  5) Run the Input Generator script: $ python mpDriver_Input_Generator.py
  6) Run the Set up script: $ python Set_Up_mpDriver_Parallel.py
  7) Run the compiling script $ python compile_fortran_code.py
  8) Run simulations $ python run_mpDriver_parallel.py
